Building an Evoting System using Blockchain

The COVID19 pandemic has reignited a debate about the use of e-voting systems
with detractors citing security concerns as the primary reason why they are against
these systems. With the rapid development of technology however, it is possible
that in the near future public perceptions around e-voting will inevitably change. A
blockchain is a growing list of records which are linked using cryptography. Each
block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and
transaction data. Blockchain has gained increasing popularity in recent years as a
result of being a keystone of the popular cryptocurrencies. The fact that this
technology is decentralized and secure also makes it a perfect candidate for e-voting
applications.

A student is expected to deliver a stand-alone proof of concept blockchain evoting
system. The system should provide a decentralised architecture to run and support
a voting scheme that is open, fair, and independently verifiable. The student is also
expected to deliver an extensive attack surface analysis of the system.
